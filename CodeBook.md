Variables in tidy data set (total 88 feature variables extracted):

    "subject"
    "activity"
    "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"
    "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
    "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
    "tBodyAcc-std()-X"
    "tBodyAcc-std()-Y"
    "tBodyAcc-std()-Z"
    "tGravityAcc-mean()-X"
    "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y"
    "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z"
    .... 
    ....

For each feature variable, average is calculated for each "subject" and each "activity". For each calculated average, no unit is associated since features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1] in original raw data.
